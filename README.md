Maze Game called Rubyverse
Intro
    puts - Your plane bound for Fiji has been .reversed to Ijif and you have entered the Rubyverse. 
    player variable gets.chomp - For mustering purposes tell us your name
    puts - Thank you #{player}, this may be the last gem you have to offer, answer the next question carefully.

    -Having difficulties with stirng interpolation with 'puts', maybe it doesn't take variables outside it's scope? Will come back to this. 
        -DISCOVERED SYNTACTICAL ISSUE! EVEN THOUGH PUTS HAS SINGLE QUOTATIONS, IF THERE IS STRING INTERPOLATION USE DOUBLE QUOTES!! 
        - Made capitalization for Name...

        -Conditionals...

    -gets - Would you name your Child...prompt (R = Ruby, or J = JavaScript) enter R or J?
        if baby_name = R -" " [player name, babyname]

        answer_question = r
            def prompt Ruby letter
            if letter = r
            enter "You've #{playername} have entered Ruby Mansion"
            end
        #puts 
            player_name = if baby = r move on else 
         Entered the Ruby mansion, must find your way to MATZ.

        else
        
         if answered JavaScript- Disappointed MATZ, chanting MINASWAN they must be dealt with, as lastly hearing MINASWAN must be dealt with....#{playName}.pop

        Conditionals throughout...no Math for now...Optional
        elseif ruby with You chose the wrong answer which resulted in a swift Death, making MATZ cry, therefore you must die....you hear people screaming cheering MINASWAN, MINASWAN..
         (ex...JavaScript auto Death.)
